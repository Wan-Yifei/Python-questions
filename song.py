'''
A playlist is considered a repeating playlist if any of the songs contain a reference to a previous song in the playlist. Otherwise, the playlist will end with the last song which points to None.

Implement a function is_repeating_playlist that, efficiently with respect to time used, returns true if a playlist is repeating or false if it is not.

For example, the following code prints "True" as both songs point to each other.

first = Song("Hello")
second = Song("Eye of the tiger")
    
first.next_song(second);
second.next_song(first);
    
print(first.is_repeating_playlist())

class Song:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.next = None

    def next_song(self, song):
        self.next = song 
    
    def is_repeating_playlist(self):
        current = self
        names = set()
        while current is not None:
            names.add(current)
            current = current.next
            if current in names:
                return True
        return False
